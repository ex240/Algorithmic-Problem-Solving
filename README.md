# Algorithmic-Problem-Solving
Algorithmic Problem Solving class that taught us how to solve algorithmic problems on a competitive level for contests and competitions 

Code has to take in inputs given by problem (some basic sample inputs are given) and must create a program that solves the problem and pass a plethora of test cases within a time limit to receive credit for any problem. 

Code is uploaded for the problems I have solved on the various homeworks. Some problems have Easy/Medium/Hard difficulties; some problems have Small/Medium/Large subtasks; and some problems have an "extra" subtask to earn extra points for the given homework. 

The class started out with basic topics like data structures, bitmasking, trie, union find, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer and ended with more advanced topics like range queries, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, mathematical algorithmic problems, string algorithmic problems, and geometry problems.
