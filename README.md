# Algorithmic-Problem-Solving
Algorithmic Problem Solving class that taught us how to solve algorithmic problems on a competitive level for contests and competitions 

Code has to take in inputs given by problem (some basic sample inputs are given) and must create a program that solves the problem and pass a plethora of test cases within a time limit to receive credit for any problem.
